            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>We are a young but rapidly growing and ambitious organization that cooperates with Lehigh After Dark, University Productions, and WLVR (Lehigh's premier radio station) to bring to campus the best live music atmosphere possible.</p>
            <ul>
                The Music Box's goals are described as follows:
                <li>To act as a gathering place and network for Lehigh musicians where they can form bands, learn from each other's talents, and appreciate their different styles of playing and musical interstest.</li>
                <li>To provide student musicians with rehearsal space and gear (drum set, P.A. system, amps, mics, etc.) that are not provided by Lehigh.</li>
                <li>To organize and host events that allow student musicians to showcase their talents and gain experience with live performance. We currently host monthly open mic nights, the Lehigh Battle of the Bands series, acoustic showcases on the front lawn, and charity concerts such as the newly created Frattle of the Bands.</li>
                <li>To hold a database and connections with professional musicians, managers, venues, studios, labels, booking agents, and other experts within the music industry to provide student bands and musicians with opportunities to perform and network outside of the Lehigh community. We promote ambitious goals while providing the resources necessary to achieve those goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to this, we will also host musician's workshops as well as supply all other organizations on campus with our repertoire of musical acts to provide live music entertainment when needed. This means that solo musicians and musical groups joining our organization will obtain guaranteed experience in performing in front of a wide array of diverse audiences.</p>
